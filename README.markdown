# Floppy Bird

##### This is my remake of Flappy Bird, the old mobile game back from 2013. I made it using the Processing coding software.

## How to use

You must have either p5.js or Processing on your device.

Once you have the Flappy Bird opened inside either application of your choice, just press the "START" or ▶️ button and it will launch the game.

Next press the big "START" button in the middle of the screen and use you SPACEBAR to make the bird go up.

The gaol of the game is to make it between the pipes without hitting them.
